# Neora Shifrin Rosalind Functions Solutions
1. Problem 1 counted the number of nucleotides in a DNA string.
2. Problem 2 transcribed a DNA string into an RNA string by replacing T with U.
3. Problem 3's output provided the complement to a DNA string by reversing the string and replacing each nucleotide with its complement.
4. Problem 4 computed the GC content of a DNA string and returned the string with the highest GC output.
5. Problem 5 counted point mutations and returned the Hamming distance.
6. Problem 6 took the input which was an RNA string and returned the amino acids that were encoded by each RNA nucleotide triplet using a dictionary.
7. Problem 7 found a motif in DNA by providing a long and short sequence and identifying the positions in which the short sequence was found in the long sequence.
8. Problem 8 calculated protein mass by using a monoisotopic mass table.
9. Problem 9 located restriction sites by finding the reverse complement to a DNA sequence.
10. Problem 10 identified transitions and transversions between two DNA sequences.
